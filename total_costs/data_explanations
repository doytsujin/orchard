# User Cost Formulas:	
Bandwidth (bytes): (3s+1)*(log N)* hash size + commitment size + SNARK size + ciphertext size * (num ciphertexts for sum verification + 1)

Computation (seconds) : (3s+1) (log N)* hash time + commitment time + encryption time + SNARK computation time + s * addition time

These formulas will give you the total costs (those listed in the last column of each data file.) Each row is multiplied by the total number of iterations required for the run of that algorithm. (Numbers  you procure from these formulas may be smaller by a few percentages than those reported, we added some additional local benchmarks from red-zone computations)

Resulting data is in data/bw-participant.data and data/comp-participant.data (bandwidth and computation costs, respectively).


# Aggregator Cost Formulas:
Bandwidth received (bytes): N * (Committee certificate size + public key size + ciphertext size) + Inclusion proof size

Bandwidth sent (bytes): (num ciphertexts for sum verification) * (N * (Committee certificate size + public key size + ciphertext size) + Inclusion proof size)

Computation (number of cores): (N * hash time + (log N) * addition time + SNARK verification time) / (Round length)

All numbers are simply multiplied linearly by the total number of rounds. (Some numbers may be rounded for graphing purposes, so your calculations may differ slightly).

Resulting data is in data/bw-agg.data and data/comp-agg.data (bandwidth and computation costs, respectively).

The remaining two datasets, data/scale-bw-agg.data and data/scale-comp-agg.data simply use the exact same formulas as the ones above, but substitute different values of N (the bandwidth plot only shows bytes sent, but the data file contains all values).
